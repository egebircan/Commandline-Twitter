# Commandline-Twitter

Commandline-Twitter is a terminal application that lets you tweet via command line. <br/> <br/>
There are popular alternatives out there but they mostly require a Twitter developer account because under the hood they use TwitterAPI.
This is actually not user friendly since that account needs to be approved first by Twitter which takes time (like a day or two)
and also a developer account can connect with only one Twitter account. <br/> <br/>
On the other hand, Commandline-Twitter doesn't need any API-KEY configurations. It uses WebDrivers to manually log-in and send tweets.
